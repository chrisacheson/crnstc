Feel free to edit and reformat these as you see fit:


Core gameplay focus will be on combat, hacking, and infiltration.
Vehicles/drones and minor survival game elements will be a secondary priority.

Two options for setting:
Fictional/unnamed city on Earth
Mars colony

Tech level will include cybernetic enhancements, genetic engineering, and
primitive nanotech. Space exploration is in its early stages. Full-dive VR
exists, but "sleeve"/consciousness transfer technology does not. More advanced
tech may exist, but is generally unknown to the public and unavailable to the
player.


Combat system options:

D&D/d20 style
ToHit - ArmorClass + d20, if result is >= 20 attack hits
Roll weapon's damage dice and add character's strength to determine damage
Angband and Nethack use this
Simple, but lacks detail and realism. No degrees of success. Damage doesn't
impose penalties (until it kills you). Combat tends to be drawn out, which may
be more desirable for a roguelike because of permanent death.

Shadowrun/White Wolf style
Attacker rolls a number of d6s or d10s equal to their skill. Dice that meet the
target number (representing attack difficulty) are successes. Defender rolls
combat pool dice to dodge, but attacker can also use combat pool. One or more
net successes is a hit, and damage scales up based on net total number of
successes. Defender rolls body dice to reduce damage, with target number based
on weapon power vs armor rating. Damage imposes penalties to subsequent
actions.
More realistic, but possibly too deadly for a roguelike due to permanent death
and lack of allies to save you when you go down. Could change damage scaling to
compensate. Needing to make choices about combat pool also doesn't work very
well for a roguelike.

Gemstone 3/Rolemaster Style
AttackStrengh - DefenseStrength + Modifier + d100, if result is > 100 attack hits
Look up result on table based on weapon type vs armor type. Higher results will
cause more HP damage and will also cause criticals, specific wounds that cause
extra damage and additional effects. Fights are usually ended by landing a
solid critical or two, rather than just simple HP loss.
Also realistic and deadly. Specific wounds on specific body parts may work well
with the setting, since severed/mangled limbs will necessitate cybernetic
replacement.

Other options?


Features wishlist:

Crafting - maybe not as extensive as other games, but should be able to build
your own computers/vehicles/etc and scavenge discarded junk for useful parts

Factions that interact with each other, vie for territory/wealth/power, and can
be influenced by player actions

Generate game world from real-world GIS data, then build on it procedurally
from there


Possible historical timeline elements:

Second coup attempt in the US in/around 2028, this time technically successful.
There's significant resistance from portions of the military and (non LE)
federal agencies. Massive street protests and partisan violence. With the
federal government mostly paralyzed, deep blue states secede, joined by some
(parts of?) light blue states. (Could determine this procedurally, using 2020
per-county voting data.)
Look into the scenarios that the "Transition Integrity Project" gamed out for
more material here:
https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/07/25/nation/bipartisan-group-secretly-gathered-game-out-contested-trump-biden-election-it-wasnt-pretty/
(Side note, I want to know more about this RPG that they were using)
Once the dust settles, secessionist states form 2(?) blocs, one for the east
coast and one for the west coast, allied with each other. Significant tensions
on borders, but actual military conflict is minimal. Instead, red and blue try
to undermine each other through clandestine support of "freedom fighters" in
each territory.
Blue state blocs are primarily neoliberal. The corporations run the government,
in typical cyberpunk fashion.
Red state US ends up with a fascistic, theocratic character. The government
"partners with" (controls) specific favored corporations.
What's going on in the rest of the world? Who does each side ally with?
Alliances are another thing that could be procedurally determined, possibly
through the faction system.

Climate change brings higher sea levels and bigger storms. Need to account for
3-5 foot rise (possibly up to 10), plus storm surges. Coastal cities can build
barriers to manage both. They may also start building seasteads to increase
their available real estate. These would mostly be corporate-initiated and
owned, and have corporate sovereignty.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_places_on_land_with_elevations_below_sea_level
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasteading
Modern day dustbowl scenario in the midwest, crippling food supplies? Could provide more incentive for central red US faction to cooperate to some extent with coastal blue US faction.

The proliferation of cybernetic and genetic augmentations leads to the rise of
a reactionary "bioconservative" movement. While gender transitioning has become
normalized in some areas, anti-transgender hate groups still exist, and these
would be natural allies of the bioconservatives. Correspondingly, while
acceptance has led to an increase in complacency and conservatism among
transgender folks, remaining transgender rights activists are natural allies of
the transhumanists.
Also, transpeciesism? Furries and kemonomimi types would take advantage of
augmentation tech to reshape their bodies. For example, "The Black Alien", but
more so:

Misc notes:

TV Tropes has a "Real Life" section in the examples for each trope, which
should be pretty useful. Apparently infiltration via air ducts is actually a
thing, but it tends to be a lot more difficult than in movies and such:

What real-world dimensions should a game tile represent?
5 feet by 5 feet? (D&D style)
1 meter by 1 meter? (Does the world finally standardize on metric?)
For a working example, my bedroom is about 12' by 13.5'. The important objects
to represent are a queen-size bed, computer desk/chair/side table, gun cabinet,
dresser, large shelving unit, and closet.
Using 5'x5' tiles, with rounding the room would be 2x3, for a total of 6 tiles.
We'd ignore the chair and side table, each feature would be one tile, and the
room would be completely filled, leaving no floor space:
#+##
#DC#	D: dresser, C: closet
#gs#	g: gun cabinet, s: shelving unit
#bd#	b: bed, d: desk
####
Using 1mx1m tiles, the room would be 4x4 (3.66mx4.11m):
#+####
#D sC#
#g   #
#bbcd#	c: chair
#bb t#	t: side table
######
1mx1m would be better for indoor environments, but need to figure out if it'll
make outdoor distances too large.
Highway lanes are 12' (3.66m) wide
Football fields are 360' (110m) long (with end zones)
My yard is about 60' (18.3m) wide and 156' (47.5m) long
How far out should field of view extend in clear daylight conditions?
Need to think about z-levels (elevation) too
Things don't need to be perfectly to scale, but should be somewhat realistic.
In Cataclysm:DDA for example, my SUV is 4x7, and roads are sized to match, but
trees are 1x1, and the difference is kind of jarring.
https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/5xqvh3/whats_the_scale_of_your_grid/

Ideas for z-levels. Might be worth checking out X@COM to see how it's done
there:
https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/6f55z2/multilevel_topdown_textbased_roguelike_ideas_for/
https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/k13ye2/zlevelsfaux3d/
X-Com Z-levels worked quite well when coupled with an easy-to-use clickable "enemy spotted" icon to ease fighting across multiple heights.

Cybernetics will need to be powered. Glucose fuel cells are an option for very
low power implants, but larger/hungrier ones will require batteries and
external charging. For someone with a proper residence this wouldn't be an
issue (and should be handled automatically along with eating), but homeless and
squatters will need to account for it.
Figure out the theoretical maximum sustained power output for a normal caloric
intake. Could use urine glucose level as a proxy for how much power is
practically available without negatively affecting the body.

https://cen.acs.org/articles/94/web/2016/07/Glucose-fueled-power-source-delivers.html
Could possibly have black market tech allowing one to jack in to charge cyber off of electric car charging stations and the like.

Once we get around to implementing crafting, we may want to go with the
"knowledge is scarce" approach that Cataclysm:DDA uses. For a lot of things
it'll be trivial to find build instructions on the internet, but the stuff that
the player will really be interested in may be harder to come by. Military
weapon systems, high-grade ECM/ECCM, etc. Would need to raid or hack
corporate/government facilities to obtain the designs.

"Dynamic" lighting? As in per-tile light levels based on local light sources,
rather than the usual lit/unlit approach taken by most roguelikes. Would be
great for atmosphere, but could get too computationally intensive.

How to simulate an entire world in a computationally feasible way?
Abstract micro-level activity to the macro level when the player isn't around
to observe what's actually happening. At the highest level, simulate the
actions of countries, megacorps, and other global-scale factions, along with
"international news" events. When the player enters a new region, regenerate
that region from a deterministic seed, and catch up (abbreviating as necessary)
on any region-level activity that happened in the players absence. Catch-up
activity should be consistent with any global activity that happened during the
that period. Treat local-level activity in a similar manner to regional. At the
local level, divide the map up into sectors. Only the player's current sector
and the ones directly surrounding it would be loaded in memory.
How to have persistent NPCs that travel between map sectors?
Partially load map sectors out to some maximum commute radius?
